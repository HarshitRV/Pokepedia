# Pokepedia
A simple bot that give info on all 18 different types of pokemon . This is a simple bot curently hosted on a repl.it .Still working on it to make it more interactive and engaging . People interested in making contributions or suggesting ideas are welocome . My goal is to add more knowledge to the bot no in depth knowledge but enough to make it easier for people who play Pokemon GO and other related game .

Making this bot was a good way of applying what I learned in python , of course there is lot more to learn .
